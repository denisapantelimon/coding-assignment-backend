Welcome to your coding assignment.

In this assignment you will have to update a simple Bank Account class that can do a list of operations: 
  - Transfer
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
  - Check balance
  
The first step is to run the suite of unit tests that are already created and make sure that all of them pass. Create the missing implementation for the BankAccount class methods and update the unit tests in order to achieve 100% coverage. Some mistakes might have crept in so be very careful!

Create a branch with your name on this repository, and when you are finished just push your changes and keep everything nice and tidy in the repository!

Good luck!
